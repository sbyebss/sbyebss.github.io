Edify Image is a family of cascaded pixel-space diffusion models capable of generating photorealistic images with pixel-perfect accuracy. Using a novel Laplacian diffusion process, Edify Image excels at customization and personalization, delivering exceptional human personalization results with remarkable identity consistency. The model supports learning single and multiple humans, style transfer, text-to-image synthesis, 4K upsampling, ControlNets, and 360Â° HDR panorama generation.
