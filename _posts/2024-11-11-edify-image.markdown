Edify Image is a family of cascaded pixel-space diffusion text-to-image models capable of generating photorealistic images. Edify Image delivers exceptional human personalization results with remarkable identity consistency. The model also supports style transfer, 4K upsampling, ControlNets, and 360Â° HDR panorama generation
